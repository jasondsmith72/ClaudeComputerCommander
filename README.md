## Installation

First, ensure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Custom Setup (Recommended)

This method is best if you don't have permissions to directly modify the Claude config file or prefer a guided approach:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasondsmith72/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
```

2. Install dependencies and build:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Run the appropriate setup script based on your needs:
```bash
# For Windows with automatic configuration:
npm run setup:windows

# For guided manual setup (works on any platform):
npm run setup:custom

# For standard setup (requires write access to Claude config):
npm run setup
```

4. Follow any on-screen instructions provided by the setup script.

5. Restart Claude if it's running.

### Option 2: Add to claude_desktop_config manually

Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Windows, found at %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@jasondsmith72/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall ClaudeComputerCommander, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using the uninstall script (Recommended)

If you have the repository locally:
```bash
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run uninstall
```

If you've installed it globally:
```bash
npx @jasondsmith72/desktop-commander uninstall
```

This will:
1. Create a backup of your Claude configuration file
2. Remove all references to desktopCommander from the configuration
3. Log the changes made for reference

### Option 2: Manual uninstallation

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Remove the `desktopCommander` entry from the `mcpServers` section.

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. If you installed the package globally, uninstall it:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @jasondsmith72/desktop-commander
   ```

## New Enhanced Features

### Web Configuration Interface

Access the web-based configuration interface by running:

```
start_web_ui
```

This opens a browser interface where you can:
- Configure security settings
- Manage command aliases
- Control integrations with other MCP servers
- View system statistics
- Check for updates

### File Versioning System

Create automatic backups of files before modifications:

```
backup_file path="/path/to/yourfile.txt"
```

List available versions:

```
get_file_versions path="/path/to/yourfile.txt"
```

Restore a previous version:

```
restore_version path="/path/to/yourfile.txt" versionId="version-uuid"
```

Compare versions:

```
compare_versions path="/path/to/yourfile.txt" versionId1="old-version" versionId2="new-version"
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

Start the monitoring dashboard:

```
start_monitoring_dashboard
```

The dashboard shows:
- Command history
- File modifications
- Backup statistics
- System status

### Command Aliases

Create shortcuts for frequently used commands:

```
aliases
```

This lists all available aliases. Common examples:
- `ls` for listing directories
- `cat` for reading files
- `mkdir` for creating directories
- `dashboard` for starting the monitoring dashboard

### Enhanced Security

Set permission levels for directories:

```
security/permissions
```

Permission levels include:
- No Access (0)
- Read-Only (1)
- Read & Write (2)
- Read, Write & Execute (3)
- Full Access (4)

### Integration with Other MCP Servers

Enable or list other MCP servers:

```
integrations
```

Supported integrations:
- puppeteer
- memory
- github
- weather
- brave_search
- fetch

## Configuration

### Allowed Directories
By default, Claude can only access:
1. The current working directory (where the server is running from)
2. The user's home directory

You can customize this by editing the `config.json` file in the root of the project:

```json
{
  "blockedCommands": [
    "format",
    "mount",
    "umount",
    ...
  ],
  "allowedDirectories": [
    "~",                 // User's home directory
    "~/Documents",       // Documents folder
    "~/Projects",        // Projects folder
    ".",                 // Current working directory
    "/path/to/folder"    // Any absolute path
  ]
}
```

**Notes on allowed directories:**
- Use `~` to refer to the user's home directory
- Use `.` to refer to the current working directory
- You can specify absolute paths as well
- For security reasons, each path is validated before access is granted

### Blocked Commands
You can configure which commands are blocked by editing the `blockedCommands` array in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "blockedCommands": [
    "format",
    "mount",
    "umount",
    "mkfs",
    "fdisk",
    "dd",
    "sudo",
    "su",
    ...
  ]
}
```

src/main.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("old message");
=======
console.log("new message");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [Installation Troubleshooting Guide](INSTALLATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common installation issues
2. Check the monitoring dashboard for error logs
3. Verify permissions in the configuration UI
4. Run `check_for_updates` to ensure you have the latest version
5. Visit the web configuration interface for detailed system status
6. Ensure your desired file paths are in the allowed directories configuration
7. If you're getting "access denied" errors, use the `list_allowed_directories` tool to see which directories are accessible
